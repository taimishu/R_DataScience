####EXERCISES############
What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?
  geom_bar() and geom_col have different default stat counts. geom_bar() has the default stat of stat_count while geom_col() has the default stat of stat_identity.

Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?
most geoms and stat have similar names, e.g. the default stat of geom_smooth is stat_smooth.

In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?
if group = 1 is not specified, then all the bars from the plot will have the same exact height.
