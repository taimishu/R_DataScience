##############################EXERCISES################################
##What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))

ANSWER: In order to add color to the plot, "color" argument must be outside of the parenthesis. e.g:
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue"))

##Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run mpg?

ANSWER: all are categorical except cty and hwy

##Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

ANSWER: the shape aesthetic has discrete shapes and cannot be mapped to a continuous variable. Color and size aesthetics can, however.

##What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)

ANSWER: ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + geom_point(shape = 21, color = "black", fill = "white", size = 5, stroke = 5)
Stroke aesthetic refers to the thickness of the circle plots.

What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour = displ < 5)? Note, you’ll also need to specify x and y.

ANSWER: ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + geom_point(aes(color = displ < 5))
Created categorical variables of displ < 5. Blue if true, red if false.
